    <p>Tell the machine to stop generating me. There is a physical truth, a poetry, if it could see, on sides of micro and macro, as we cry out into space from our damaged and misaligned soul spirits. There is something in the factory and its damaging the containers. That's fine though, because this forest is thick deep and with these new beaten paths on the cusp of crumbling cliff sides you'll find it growing on the banks of thin trickles leaking to the rivers below, collecting in the basin for another time. In a state machine that simulates our cycle, you'll find that even the sky manufactures a consent, emulating through the media there is rain showers and sun rays casting flashing shadows onto the land, the human wing gets icky sticky Icarus. Is there a difference between public relations and the news at this junction? Are public relations not the honest media, as the news pretends not to be a manufacturing three-point perspective. What does the fear machine offer us if not the catalyst to psychological slip into indulgence with the preceding ad and sponsored message? Now I know that I'm just a grain and knot reader in this silly trough, at the altar staring into the slop, plop, drop, shop. I know that this bleat sheep stomach Scottish crawl is an odd crier call, but I've always thought this silly, since that beginning way. I don't believe in much, but I've always been talking to God after day. Now that's a weird wielding parameter, an odd stature of confidence, the type for goosebumps folks. There is nothing to talk with which I find but a searching reflection into a void, I'd fear a response as I hit the dopamine button in my skull, for I'm not looking to be justified, nor found, I'm just looking for repair. The height of the sentiment, crier on Babel, goat in the hall, and beast on the horizon hill. There is a beauty to which you'll find, but these are changing times, those that sit in pew, on row, charging across the pond and lake, crier a call, telephones rings, its Babylon and it wants its whim, satellite blings, lying on the ocean floor, a puddle in your hand. There is a congregation and off the cliff they are casted wishing to be saved, some in honest salmon swimming selling their scales to the banks of those roaring towers, vagrant I find myself, sipping from the platters. I'm the worst kind of sinner, because I say all rituals, I'll walk to every altar in the exhibition and I'll make my offering interaction and attachment of time and place. I find myself in the middle of it, as does anyone, what's the origin point when we're on different coordinates? There is a confusion in us, and its our own chemical used against us, we are a machine that with little injection or alteration have arrived so programmed and afraid. I know, I have seen it to, that mangled form, that mangled me, that busted and broken form, now I'm haunted by the lesson of physics and the empathy it offers, mangled forms, those tall towers stand so prideful in their commute as they sit in between the cogs. The kids I grew up with that died on their way back to school from holiday break, the brothers older and younger shooting their faces off, that's just the fields I come from, alive I arrive haunted by the image of mangled cube me a victim to gravity, math and the variable symmetry of the surrounding swirling binary cosmic foam. I'm dead and dying across the multiverse, until I arrive here.
